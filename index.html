<p>Did you know that many dynamic libraries (<code>*.so</code>) on your system are not actually
binaries but rather ASCII files?</p>

<p>It seems no matter how long I work with the command line, every once in a while
I find handy utilities I've never encountered before. Most people have heard
about <strike>the bird</strike> <a href="https://www.gnu.org/software/coreutils/">coreutils</a>, that's where utilities such as
<code>echo</code>, <code>cat</code>, and others come from. But did you know about <a href="https://joeyh.name/code/moreutils/">moreutils</a>?</p>

<p>I don’t like Bash. It’s just too confusing. Do I need to use double brackets
for this? Do I need to quote this? Am I still writing <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bash_(Unix_shell)">Bash</a> or am I sprinkling in
some bits of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bourne_shell">sh</a>? I can never remember.</p>

<p>The next major version of NPM brings a number of improvements over the previous
versions in terms of speed, security, and a bunch of other <a href="https://blog.npmjs.org/post/161276872334/npm5-is-now-npmlatest">nifty
things</a>. What
stands out from the user's perspective however is the new lock file. Actually
lock <em>files</em>. More on that in a second. For the uninitiated, a <code>package.json</code>
file describes the top level dependencies on other packages using
<a href="https://semver.org/">semver</a>. </p>

<p>Arel is the kind of library that many of us Rails developers use on a daily
basis and might not even know about it. So what's this library whose name only
pops up when everything else fails all about?</p>

<span class="published">Published Mar 16, 2014</span>
<p>Make and all of its flavours have been here for almost 40 years and it's a tool
hard to beat for many things. There are however cases when you do not need the
power of Make and are willing to trade the flexibility for something else. In
